This repo is a test for learning how to use Git and GitHub. It was initialized with no files and no commits on GitHub and initialized with this README file on the command line.
The commands used for its initialization are the following:

git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/SnakeWhisperer/git-test-2.git
git push -u origin master

Note that this differs from what GitHub recommends when creating the repo from the command line. No 'main' branch is created and the push is made from the initial 'master' branch in the local repo.
This is done to see what consequences it has.
